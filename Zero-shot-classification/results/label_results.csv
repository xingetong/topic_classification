(i will mention that this is not the only game with this problem and it is less a fault of the game itself and more of a fault of the method used.)aside from these things, there seems to just be a general lack of content. while i have only actually played hours of the game, i have also watched several streamers and youtubers playing it as well i and what i have noticed is that everybody is basically doing the exact same things over and over again. land on a planet; mine some resources; ""discover"" some buildings, plants and creatures; go to a place to sell your resources; upgrade your ship, suit and omnitool; rinse and repeat. it all just seems extremely grindy and i can pretty confidently say that i have just described the entire game in a nutshell.in the last paragraph you will notice that i put ""discover"" in quotes. the reason for that is that when playing no man is sky, while you are technically finding places and creatures that you have not seen before, it still feels the same. i know i have gone over this already with the creatures and environments, but i just can not state this enough. this once again comes down to procedural generation, everything that is created is basically variations on the same things over and over and over again. it get is very repetetive and boring very quickly and that on top of the grind that i mentioned earlier just compounds the problem and makes the game feel generally boring overall.one other thing i would like to add to my thoughts in the last paragraph, is that the buildings you find are also incredibly limited. after extensively exploring planets i already feel like i have seen most if not all of the buildings in the game and i can imagine that this does not change as you get further into it. once again this just speaks to the lack of content that i mentioned earlier.lastly before i come to my conclusion in this review, i would like to quickly touch on the subject of the flight mechanics. the spaceflight in this game is quite clunky; especially on planets. one of the things which i very quickly noticed is that there is a lower altitude limit in which the game physically will not let your ship go below (unless you are landing); this can get incredibly annoying when you are trying to land in a specific location or when fighting other ships on planets. it makes it so that you can not look down when you need to be able to look down and ultimately makes you feel more limited in your range of motion while flying around. what i would personally like to see is full freedom in your range of motion even if it means you can accidentally slam into a mountain or the ground at full speed.so, in conclusion: while i really wanted to enjoy this game, i simply could not. no man is sky offers you a massive universe with very limited gameplay and a never ending grind; unfortunately this simply results in boredom for the player. i do believe that this game does have potential, but they really need to add more content and features in order to make it less grindy at the very least. this game in it is current state should have been released as early access and definitely was not worth the if it was only i would be much more forgiving, but for the price they are asking; they need to bring more to the table than what no man is sky currently brings.unfortunately, i cannot recommend purchasing this game currently; especially at the current price point."

(maybe future patch?)crafting is less cringey than it once was, but still could be improved. i really hope that hello games has plans to expand craftable commodities and equipment. imagine no mans sky with the commodity market that everyone versus everyone has... imagine...combat is still... not that great. would like to see hello games expand this area more. player versus player considerations would be nice.on the player versus player note... we still do not have a persistant sandbox mmo, but there are mechanisms that seem to be working in that direction. i am not really sure how hello games games is going to proceed but i certainly hope they have a longer game plan for how massively multiplayer online game will work in nms... missions make more sense than ever. inventory management is less frustrating. i hope hello games continues to optimize the game user interface because there is still more work that could be done. clicking and dragging items is a huge improvement... now let us swap with a click. i swear guys... play a few other games and study how they do it.... because it still kinda sucks. oh, on that note, i am really happy they addressed my issue the teleportation of items to your ship by making it an upgrade players need to unlock (a point that i brought up in my original review... did someone actually read that?!)with all the new positives happening in no mans sky i have found myself playing it a lot and looking forward to playing it when i am not playing it. that is enough to make me switch my review to a recommendation.nice job hg. but keep at it please. i still feel that there is more work to be done and your player base will thank you for it. * original purchase review *ripped off.that is how many of us feel about this game. can not say that i feel any different. sure... there are a few graces about this game. unfortunately the negatives dramatically outweigh the positive. here are the major issues i have with this game. - not a persisent massively multiplayer online game sandbox (as insinuated by developers leading up to release) - a vast, static and repetative universe. - npcs are hollow, stationary... boring - object collision only applies to some objects... what? - stupid stupid stupid grinding - planets have one consistent biome from pole to pole... c amon.... - i have teleportation tech, but i am running my ass all over the planet... what? - no maps... whats?!i could go on, but those are the top picks. i am not even going to talk about the things i like about this game because frankly i am too upset. i followed the development of this game for years and i was legitimately rooting for the developers to succeed. now i just feel ripped off. had the developers been more upfront about the nature of this game and priced it more reasonably i might have been more inclined to enjoy this game... but man... i tried so long to like this and i just can not bring myself to play it anymore because its just too damn boring and lame and stupid and i want my money back... *shakes fistfingers crossed for star citizen."
